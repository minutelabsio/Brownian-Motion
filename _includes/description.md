An interactive physics simulation of Brownian Motion!
Brownian Motion is the random motion of particles that are suspended in
a gas or a liquid. Drag the first slider to see what's going on behind
the scenes and play around with the physical parameters. You can also
download a snapshot if your particles draw you something inspiring.

Note: There is a lot of physics going on here... if it seems sluggish,
